# voteDJ- A Work In Progress

A personal repository for working on the voteDJ iOS application

## Purpose

This application aims to solve the age old problem- what do you play at a party? Perhaps only applicable to the college aged student, this application solves this brutal problem by allowing crowdsourcing of music selection. Members of the party can add songs, as well as upvoting and downvoting the seelections, all using the Spotify API. This application is sure to make the music at your parties satisfying to all your guests.
